# Koto
A shitty compiler and "toolset" for Koto, a shitty language for controlling deep diving robots (among other things) in a game that does not exist yet.

# Development
I'm working with with the 64-bit Mono version of the [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot): v3.1.1.stable.mono.official.

Current features:
 * Grouping with parentheses
 * Basic arithmetic with +, -, * and /
 * Logical operations: !, >, <, ==, >= and >=

# How to try?
Clone the repo and open in Godot I guess? I have not tried.

# Big up
Huge thanks to [@munificent](https://github.com/munificent) for writing [Crafting Interpreters](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/). It's an excellent book on this subject and the only thing keeping me sane.
